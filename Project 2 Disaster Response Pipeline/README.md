## 1. [Project Overview](#-Project-Overview)
This project is part of the [Udacity Data Science Nano Degree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)and supported by [Appen](https://appen.com/). This project will analyze a [data set](https://github.com/petitblue/Udacity_Data_Science/tree/main/Project%202%20Disaster%20Response%20Pipeline/data) containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. Those messages are sent from social media or from disaster response organizations. This project will build a ETL pipeline to load and process data, and a machine learning pipeline to classify those messages so as to send them to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
## 2. [Project-Components]
There are three components in the project.
### 1. ETL Pipeline
Loads the message.csv and categories.csv files and merges two datasets
clean data and stores it in a SQLite database
### 2. ML Pipeline
Build a test processing and maching learning pipline
Train and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
### 3. Flask Web App
There is a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
