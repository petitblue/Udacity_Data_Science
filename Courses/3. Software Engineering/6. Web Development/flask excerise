## Udacity workspace

Run your app with python run.py command
Open another terminal and type env|grep WORK this will give you the spaceid (it will start with view*** and some characters after that)
Now open your browser window and type https://viewa7a4999b-3001.udacity-student-workspaces.com, replace the whole viewa7a4999b with your space id that you got in the step 2
Press enter and the app should now run for you
Local Machine

Once your app is running (python run.py)
Go to http://localhost:3001 and the app will now run
I hope it helps
