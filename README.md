# Udacity Data Science Nano Degree

There are four main projects to complete the program:

#### 1. Solving Data Science Problems
Learn the data science process, including how to build effective data visualizations, and how to communicate with various stakeholders.
In this project, I chose the dataset from Kaggle to analyze Airbnb users booking behaviors and predict their first booking destinations. The analysis results are written as [What are Airbnb New User’s First Booking Destination ?](https://medium.com/@dengluyan).

#### 2. Data Engineering for Data Scientists
In this project, I’ll build a data pipeline to prepare message data from major natural disasters around the world. 

#### 3.Experiment Design and Recommendations
Learn to design experiments and analyze A/B test results. Explore approaches for building recommendation systems.

#### 4. Data Science Capstone Project
