## What is Airbnb New Users' first Booking Destionation?
Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home. It now has 4 million hosts providing unique places and staying experiences for users. Airbnb travelers can sleep in a cozy treehouse in the rainforest, or have a brunch in a British Castle for a Downton Abbey-style getaway.

According to the official site, users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 100,000+ cities across 220+ countries. I use the Kaggle New User Booking Project to solve the following problems:  
1. What are the features distributions?
2. Which features play important roles when a new userâ€™s book his/her first travel destination?    
4. Which country will a new user make as the first booking?  

By accurately predicting the first travel destination, Airbnb can share more personalized content to each new user, increase user experience, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.
